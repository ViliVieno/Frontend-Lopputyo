This is an app made for my frontend course. In it, the user can make notes for different classes in the "Add notes",
Look at the notes in the "List notes" and add courses in the "Add course". The app also fetches courses and notes from a netlify link.

To run the app, you need to use npm install and npm run dev. You need Node.js for it to work.

The program was made by me, with help in some sections by ChatGPT and Copilot. Below, I have listed everything that I used
AI for and which AI was used. For the sake of clarity, I made comments on the codes, where AI was used.





AI Part.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made the original MainBody.jsx and Header.jsx using Copilot.

AI On AddNotes.jsx:
Made AddNotes.jsx mostly with the course materials, but made improvements with ChatGPT
The .filter and the original handlesubmit, that was replaced with better code.
The parseInt was done with help from ChatGPT

AI on NoteStore: 
The original addNote, which was replaced with better code. 
The current addNote was implemented with improvements from ChatGPT
The current addCourses id part.

AI on ListNotes:
The showall feature implemented with help from ChatGPT
Also has a parseInt, which I copied from AddNotes.

AI on others:
The tailwind was mostly done with ChatGPT.
